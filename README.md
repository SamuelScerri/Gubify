# Notes:

Earlier versions used GPT 4o for both chatting and image detection, which was quite expensive to run. Therefore GPT 4o is only used for image detection and GPT 3.5 is used for chatting,
it's not super difficult to make it run completely on GPT 4o, check out `gubgpt.js` and mess around in it. A seperate branch will be created later which will use GPT 4o only.

# How To Run Locally:

I'm going to assume you are familiar discord.js and the Discord developer portal, if not [start here!](https://discordjs.guide)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with:

```
TOKEN=OBTAIN_TOKEN_FROM_DISCORD_DEVELOPER_PORTAL
CLIENT_ID=OBTAIN_CLIENT_ID_FROM_DISCORD_DEVELOPER_PORTAL
OPENAI_API_KEY=OBTAIN_OPENAI_KEY_FROM_OPENAI_PROJECT_DASHBOARD
```

You will then have to create two assistants running:
- GPT 4o for image detection
- GPT 3.5 Turbo 0125 for chatting (go ham, describe your own goofy goblin!)

Then replace line 10 and 15 in `gubgpt.js` with the respective newly created assistant IDs (will be changed later)

Then it's as simple as running:

```
npm install
node --env-file=.env .
```

Ta-da! A... goblin thing!
